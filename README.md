Edit the `.env file. Put correct values for each variable, otherwise the bot will not work as intended.

```env
TOKEN = 68474524156455441541564564
WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID = fwfwfwfwffwefw

```

These values are not real.

# Usage/Examples
After setting up all the ids, generate an url from discord developer portal and make the bot join your server. You can name your bot whatever you want. 
**Only turn on the intents labeled `Message Content` as that is crucial for the bot to run**. Intents are a crucial part of this bot.

If everything is done right, then you are pretty much done. Now just execute the `main.py` file.
